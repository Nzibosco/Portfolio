# Portfolio

### welcome to my portfolio page

- This page is a summary of prrojects that I am working on. 

- I used CSS to design phone mockups that a user can use to demo my projects without exiting the page. 

- the Petawesome project requires disabling chrome security to ensure our api calls correctly. 
- follow further instruction in the readme file that I have already shared on that project. 

- To showcase other projects, I used Bootstrap cards. I found the cards as an easy and clean way to reuse information in the same format. 


I will expand this web app to include functionalities such as API calls to sites where I have photos, and blog posts to update my visitors what I am up to. 

### Summary of technologies I used 

### HTML:
I used HTML to provide the general layout of the website. 
i broke the website into 5 main parts: 

1. Navbar with links to my social media profiles;
2. A Jumbotron as a welcome page with brief overview of who I am am, my profile photo, links to my LinkedIn profile and to download my Resume. 
3. The third part was dedicated to showcase one of the projects I am working on. I used iPad mockup and iframe to demo the application without leaving the page. I will constantly change the project to be displayed in this area depending on my projects' pecking order! 
4. This part is where I put Boostrap cards to provide information on other projects I am working on. Each card has project overview, technologies used, and links to Github repository and live page tto demo the application. 
5. The last part is footer with my contact address, and further information on my projects.

### Bootstrap: 
I used Bootstrap to get the Jumbotron, and Cards, and to minimize CSS needed to style the page. 
Boostrap also helped to make the page more responsive with minimal CSS media queries. 

### CSS: 
I used CSS to provide all the styling for the page.
